<h3 id="data-operations-and-analytics">Data Operations and Analytics</h3>
<p>Today‚Äôs Digital organizations produce vast quantities of data for which analysis remains a challenge requiring innovative solutions to ensure these valuable data assets can be efficiently analyzed and better understand to reveal customer preferences, market intelligence, operational &amp; strategic insights.  Modern data management architectures have evolved from the traditional data warehousing to more complex architectures enable real-time &amp; batch processing; high-velocity transactions; operational intelligence, and advanced techniques for decision support.  Analyzing large data sets requires significant compute capacity that can vary in size based on the amount of input data and the type of analysis. This characteristic of big data workloads is ideally suited to modern cloud infrastructure, where applications can easily scale up and down based on demand.</p>
